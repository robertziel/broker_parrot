## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-11

Initial public release: **broker_parrot** (import package `queue_workflows`) —
a standalone Postgres/SQLite-as-queue workflow engine. `SELECT … FOR UPDATE
SKIP LOCKED` claim loop woken by `LISTEN`, lease reclaim, DAG dispatcher with a
durable outbox, GPU warm-model cache, watchdog stack, durable per-node event
log, operator worker ON/OFF control plane, multi-tenant `project` scoping, and
pluggable storage backends (SQLite default, Postgres, plus the opt-in
Redis/MongoDB flat-queue SPI). Postgres via `psycopg` 3 is the only hard
runtime dependency for the `pg` backend; the SQLite default runs daemon-less.

The `queue-broker-web` control plane ships hardened: fail-closed non-loopback
bind (`QUEUE_WORKFLOWS_BROKER_WEB_TOKEN` must be a real secret — set, not a
placeholder, ≥ 16 chars — or the service refuses to start; loopback stays
open), timing-safe bearer comparison, a 1 MiB request-body cap (`413`), a
bounded request thread pool (`QUEUE_WORKFLOWS_BROKER_WEB_MAX_WORKERS`, default
32), and sanitized error responses.
